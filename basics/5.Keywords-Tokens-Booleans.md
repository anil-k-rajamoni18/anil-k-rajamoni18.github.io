## Tokens , Character Set , Keywords , Boolean's

### Character Set
- Its a set of characters that can be used to create values, variables, expressions etc.
- Following are the characters that we can use in C programming language.

### What is Token?
> The smallest individual unit in a program is known as token.

Following are the tokens used in C programming language.

-   Keywords
-   Identifiers
-   Constants
-   Strings
-   Special Symbols
-   Operators


### Keywords

- Keywords are the words that conveys a special meaning to the language compiler and are reserved for special purpose
- Hence must not be used as normal identifier name/Variable name.

### Escape Sequence
- These are special backslash character constants.

**Example**

```c
printf("Hello");
printf("World !\n");

printf("Hello \n SaiMedha");
```

### C  Booleans
- Very often, in programming, we will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:

-   YES / NO
-   ON / OFF
-   TRUE / FALSE

- For this, C has a  `bool`  data type, which is known as  **booleans**.
- Booleans represent values that are either  `true`  or  `false`.
- In C, the  `bool`  type is not a built-in data type, like  `int`  or  `char`.
- It was introduced in C99, and you must  **import**  the following header file to use it:
```c
#include <stdbool.h>
```

- A boolean variable is declared with the `bool` keyword and can only take the values `true` or `false`

```c
bool isSaiMedhaStudent = true;  
bool isEmployee = false;
```

-   `1`  (or any other number that is not 0) represents  `true`
-   `0`  represents  `false`

```c
// Create boolean variables  
bool isSaiMedhaStudent = true;  
bool isEmployee = false;
  
// Return boolean values  
printf("%d", isSaiMedhaStudent ); // Returns 1 (true)  
printf("%d", isEmployee ); // Returns 0 (false)
```
