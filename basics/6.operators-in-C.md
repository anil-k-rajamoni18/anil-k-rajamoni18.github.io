## Operators & Type-Casting

### Operators 

- Operator is a symbol used to perform specific operation.
- Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

```c
int myNum = 100 + 50; // do addition operation on two operands.
```

#### Types of Operators in C
- C has many built-in operators and can be classified into 6 types:
		1.  Arithmetic Operators
		2.  Relational Operators
		3.  Logical Operators
		4.  Bitwise Operators
		5.  Assignment Operators
		6.  Other Operators

	**1. Arithmetic Operations**
- Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

**2.  Relational Operators**
- Relational operators are used to compare two values (or variables). 
- The return value of a comparison is either `1` or `0`, which means **true** (`1`) or **false** (`0`).

```c
int x = 5;  
int y = 3;  
printf("%d", x > y); // returns 1 (true) because 5 is greater than 3
```

### Try it
- Can we apply relational operators on characters?
			

**3.Logical Operators**
- Logical operators are used to combine the more than one condition

**4.Bitwise Operators**
- The Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations on the operands. 
- The operators are first converted to bit-level and then the calculation is performed
- Can be performed at the bit level for faster processing.
- We cannot apply bitwise operator to float and double.

**5. Assignment Operators**
- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

**6.  Other Operators**

### **  
**i. sizeof operator**

-   sizeof is much used in the C programming language.
-   It is a compile-time unary operator which can be used to compute the size of its operand.
-   The result of sizeof is of the unsigned integral type which is usually denoted by size_t.
-   Basically, the sizeof the operator is used to compute the size of the variable.

**ii. Comma Operator**

-   The comma operator (represented by the token) is a binary operator that evaluates its first operand and discards the result, it then evaluates the second operand and returns this value (and type).
-   The comma operator has the lowest precedence of any C operator.
-   Comma acts as both operator and separator.

**iii. Conditional/Ternary Operator**

-   The conditional operator is of the form  _**Expression1? Expression2: Expression3**_
-   Here, 
	- Expression1 is the condition to be evaluated. 
	- If the condition(Expression1) is  _True_  then we will execute and return the result of Expression2 
	- otherwise if the condition(Expression1) is  _false_  then we will execute and return the result of Expression3.

**Example-1**
```c
# include  <stdio.h>
int  main(){
	int  age  =  27;

	(age>=18)? (printf("eligible for voting")) : (printf("not eligible for voting"));

	return  0;
}
```

**Example-2**
```c
# include  <stdio.h>
int  main(){

int  a=5,b;
b=((a==5)?(3):(2));
printf("The value of 'b' variable is : %d",b);

return  0;
}
```


**iv.**  **dot (.) and arrow (->) Operators**

-   Member operators are used to referencing individual members of classes, structures, and unions.
-   The dot operator is applied to the actual object.
-   The arrow operator is used with a pointer to an object.


 **v. Cast Operator**

-   Casting operators convert one data type to another. 
	- For example, int(2.2000) would return 2.
-   A cast is a special operator that forces one data type to be converted into another.
-   The most general cast supported by most of the C compilers is as follows 
	- âˆ’ **[ (type) expression ]**.



 #### **vi. &,* Operator**

-   Pointer operator & returns the address of a variable. 
	- For example &a; will give the actual address of the variable.
-   The pointer operator * is a pointer to a variable. 
	- For example *var; will pointer to a variable var.


### Operators Precedence
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression and decides how an expression is evaluated
- Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.
- The sequence in which operations are carried out in an expression in C is determined by operator precedence.

## Try it

**Example-1**
```c
#include  <stdio.h>
int  main() {
	int  x  =  2, y  =  3, z  =  4;
	int  result  =  x  +  y  *  z;
	printf("Result: %d\n", result);

	int  a  =  5, b  =  6, c  =  7;
	int  result2  = (a  +  b) *  c;
	printf("Result2: %d\n", result2);

	int  d  =  8, e  =  9, f  =  10;
	int  result3  =  d  +  e  %  f;
	printf("Result3: %d\n", result3);

	int  g  =  11, h  =  12, i  =  13;
	int  result4  =  g  *  h  /  i;

	printf("Result4: %d\n", result4);
	int  j  =  14, k  =  15, l  =  16;

	int  result5  =  j  ==  k  ||  l  >  k;
	printf("Result5: %d\n", result5);

	return  0;

}
```

**Example-2**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  int x, a=4, b=2;
  x = a * a - 3 * b + a / b;

  printf("x = %d\n", x);
  return 0;
}
```
## Type-Casting
- Typecasting in C is the process of converting one data type to another data type
- Typecasting allows us to convert one data type into other. 
- In C language, we use cast operator for typecasting which is denoted by **(type)**.

- **Types**
	-   Implicit type casting
	-   Explicit type casting


#### Implicit type casting
- Implicit type casting is done by compiler automatically.
- When the type conversion is performed automatically by the compiler without programmers intervention, such type of conversion is known as implicit type conversion or type promotion.

```c
# include  <stdio.h>
int  main() {
float  n1  =  10;
float  n2  =  3;
double  n3  =  n1  +  n2;
printf("result = %f" , n3);
}
```

#### Explicit type casting
- Explicit type casting done by programmer manually.
- we have to force the conversion between data types
- It performs the conversions with altering the values, possibility of loss of data.
- If we downgrade from a higher data type to a lower data type then it causes lose of bits.
	For example: 
		- Moving from `double` to `float` causes rounding of digits.
		- Downgrading from `float` to `int` causes truncation of the fractional part.
```c
# include  <stdio.h>
int  main(){

	int  a  =  15, b  =  2;
	char  x  =  'a';
	double  div;

	div  = (double)a  /  b;
	x  =  x  +  3;

printf("The result of Implicit typecasting is %c\n", x);
printf("The result of Explicit typecasting is %f", div);

return  0;

}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  float x = 24.5, y = 7.2;
  
  int result = (int) x / (int) y;
  printf("Result = %d\n", result);
  return 0;
}
```

**Rules**
1.  All integer types to be converted to float.
2.  All float types to be converted to double.
3.  All character types to be converted to integer.

**Observation**
- int + int = int 
- int / int = int  
- int/float = float , float/int = float (same with double)
-
