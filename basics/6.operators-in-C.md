## Operators & Type-Casting

### Operators 

- Operator is a symbol used to perform specific operation.
- Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

```c
int myNum = 100 + 50; // do addition operation on two operands.
```

#### Types of Operators in C
- C has many built-in operators and can be classified into 6 types:
		1.  Arithmetic Operators
		2.  Relational Operators
		3.  Logical Operators
		4.  Bitwise Operators
		5.  Assignment Operators
		6.  Other Operators

	**1. Arithmetic Operations**
- Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

**2.  Relational Operators**
- Relational operators are used to compare two values (or variables). 
- The return value of a comparison is either `1` or `0`, which means **true** (`1`) or **false** (`0`).

```c
int x = 5;  
int y = 3;  
printf("%d", x > y); // returns 1 (true) because 5 is greater than 3
```

### Try it
- Can we apply relational operators on characters?
			

**3.Logical Operators**
- Logical operators are used to combine the more than one condition

**4.Bitwise Operators**
- The Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations on the operands. 
- The operators are first converted to bit-level and then the calculation is performed
- Can be performed at the bit level for faster processing.
- We cannot apply bitwise operator to float and double.

**5. Assignment Operators**
- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
